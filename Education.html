  <h2>Education Background</h2>
  <p style="color:black;">I began my education at Wogagen Htsade Kindergarten, where I studied for three years.
After that, from grades 4 to 8, I attended another school called Bele Buqisa Elementary School.
I had excellent academic performance and was a student who valued education highly.
Later, I took the grade 8 national examination in 2010 E.C. and successfully passed.
Then, I advanced to grade 9.
My school years from grades 1 to 8 were truly a joyful and memorable time for me.
From 2011 to 2014 E.C., I studied from grade 9 to grade 12 at Wenago Mesenado Secondary School.  
After that, in 2014 E.C., I took the national entrance exam, but unfortunately,
I didn’t get a passing result at that time. However, although I didn’t qualify through the regular entrance,
I joined a remedial program and was admitted to Wolaita Sodo University in 2015 E.C. After receiving my results,
I continued my studies there. Currently, I am a third-year Computer Science student at Wolaita Sodo University.
