    <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>I was born and raised in the lush and welcoming land of the Southern Nations, 
  Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR), in the Gedeo Zone, Wenago town.
  Our area is also famous for enset and coffee. I’m not sure why, but I really love coffee."
  Growing up as the eldest in my family, I learned early the values of 
  responsibility, care, and determination. I have two sisters and three brothers, 
  all of whom inspire me every day to work hard and dream big.
</p>
  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p>
  I am deeply passionate about art — painting and visual creativity bring me peace 
  and joy. I also love reading books, especially those that tell real-life stories 
  and explore different cultures and perspectives. Through art and reading, 
  I find new ways to express myself and understand the world around me.
</p>
    
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>
  My goal is to become a creative and skilled web developer who designs websites 
  that are both visually appealing and user-friendly. I aim to combine my love 
  for art and technology to build meaningful digital experiences that inspire 
  and connect people across the world.
